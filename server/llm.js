In the 22nd century, foxes are the playful superpowers. They unveil secrets of the world on a daily basis, through a mechanism known as 'heads or tails' (no, it's not coin flipping, just some fox magic outside of the reach of languages). Fox Newroll Network (FoxNN) is a news agent that regularly publishes important discoveries through this way.

What can the topics of the next issue be? List 6 of your absolute favourites. Write each as a simple, concise, short sentence; for discoveries, there is no need to include its source (the discoverer, the source material, etc.). Let your imagination go wild ^ ^ Be as nonsensical as possible, but keep in mind to keep the concepts somehow related (just in an unexpected way). Reply only with the sentences in a Markdown list.
