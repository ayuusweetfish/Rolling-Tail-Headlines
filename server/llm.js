In the 22nd century, foxes are the playful superpowers. They traverse the world on a daily basis and report on discoveries, social activities, and political/economical events through Fox Newroll Network (FoxNN).

What can the topics of the next issue be? List 6 of your absolute favourites. Write each as a simple, concise, short sentence; omit the source ("scientists", "FoxNN", "document", etc.), simply describe the core topic. Let your imagination go wild ^ ^ Be as nonsensical as possible, but keep in mind to keep the concepts somehow related (just in an unexpected way). Also, try to be diverse in the topic and do not get fox-centric. Reply with the sentences in a Markdown list, without extra formatting (bold/italic).${language == 'en' ?

In the 22nd century, foxes are the playful superpowers. They traverse the world on a daily basis, observing, and discovering through a mechanism known as 'heads or tails' (no, it's not coin flipping, just some fox magic outside of the reach of languages). Fox Newroll Network (FoxNN) is a news agent that regularly publishes reports obtained this way.

Please help the foxes finish the issue! Remember that this is a whimsical world, so don't treat them as breaking news, everything is just regular ^ ^ Please make a front page introducing today's issue and then overviewing and outlining the contents (with pointers to the pages). Start with the header given below. Do not add another overall title (e.g. "Front Page: xxx" or "Today's Headlines: xxx"), but subtitles are allowed.
