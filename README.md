Inquiring minds alike, Fox Newroll Network (FoxNN) gets you covered! In the 22nd century, foxes are the playful super-wizards. They traverse the world on a daily basis, observing, and discovering through a mechanism known as 'heads or tails' (no, it's not coin flipping, just some fox magic outside of the reach of languages).

Bring your cup of moonbeam tea, join the foxes in their adventure for this issue.
